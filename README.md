## Project Description

This project is a demo portfolio website which has been written using template engine Pug formerly known as jade. Pug's friendly syntax and programmable functionalitiesl like <include>, <mixin>s, <conditional> statements are very helpful which enables to repeat lines of code witout copying them as we do it traditional html.

## Project Structure

Once cloning the project using `git clone https://github.com/ihnaqi/Portfolio-Website-Pug-Jade-.git` open folder <frontend> in the command line using `cd Frontend`, here you will see an `index.pug` file and some folders too which I have structured you don't need to worry about.
Once you are inside `Frontend` folder run this command in the terminal `pug -w ./ -o ./HTML -P`, this will make html file compiling the `.pug` files associated with the `index.pug` file. In order to run `pug watcher` `node` and `pug cli` must be installed on your computer. If you haven't installed both on your PC then follow the following links.
